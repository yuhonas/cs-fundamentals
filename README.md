# Stuff you should know as a developer

I recently resigned from my job and took a four month break this is a personal laundry list of high level stuff I wanted to non exhaustively revise to identify any gaps in my knowledge before venturing back

My approach to learning has always been to understand the history, the *why* and learn principles over methods.

_If you learn only methods, you'll be tied to your methods. But if you learn principles, you can devise your own methods. -Ralph W Emerson_
