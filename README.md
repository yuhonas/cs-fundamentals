## How to use it?

My approach to learning has always been to understand the history, the *why* and learn principles over methods.

_If you learn only methods, you'll be tied to your methods. But if you learn principles, you can devise your own methods. -Ralph W Emerson_

1.  Fork it
2.  Work through each TODO or until you're happy you're covered
